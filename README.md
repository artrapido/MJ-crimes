# MJ-crimes
Insight mining in data concerning MJ-related crimes in Denver, CO. Contains a dashboard as well.

The principal question of the project was determination of key features and factors of MJ-related crimes committed in Denver in connection with industrial 
(on the one hand) and non-industrial (on the other hand) objects or victims. 

The data used was taken from the Denver Police Department and covered the period between years 2015 and 2020. 
The project highlighted several geographycal units where certain kinds of crimes are more likely to be committed and suggested that MJ-related delinquency in Denver 
is criminologically closer to property-oriented one and should be combatted accordingly. 

However, the most important outcome was that any single aspect of a crime (be it locale, type or time) is never sufficient to make good predictions on the rest of 
the aspects, at least on industrial/non-industrial nature of the crime.
